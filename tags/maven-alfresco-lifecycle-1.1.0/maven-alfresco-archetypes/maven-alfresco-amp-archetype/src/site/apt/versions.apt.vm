 AMP used versioning scheme

Progressive Versioning Scheme

 This scheme was designed to:
 
 * reach properties single sourcing from the POM (so to automatically fill module.properties based on POM properties)
 
 * to be able to use Maven SNAPSHOT capabilities during development
 
 * maintain a senseful progressive order in the versions and builds
 
and had to overcome the following shortcomings:
 
 * Alfresco Module Packages (AMPs) versions cannot contain letters (therefore no -SNAPSHOT is allowed)
 
For this the AMP version (in the module.properties) is filtered to be equals to: 

<<<module.version=${noSnapshotVersion}.${buildNumber}>>>
 
where:
 
 * noShapshotVersion --> is anything before '-SNAPSHOT' in the current POM version, generated by the maven-no-snapshot-plugin 
 
 * buildNumber --> is the buildNumber generated by the maven-buildnumber-plugin from the SCM information for your project, or defaults to 1 if no SCM was configured 


Custom Versioning Schemes
  
  You can always maintain your <<<module.properties>>> version manually and remove the plugins invocations from the generated POMs.
