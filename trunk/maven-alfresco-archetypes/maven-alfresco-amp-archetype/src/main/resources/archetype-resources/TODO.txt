Known Issues:
-------------



MAJOR:
- maven-amp-plugin filtering broken


MINOR:
- cannot use maven SNAPSHOT versioning as it's copied over in the module.properties
file and not accepted by alfresco as valid module version number


TRIVIAL:
- Slighly different deployment for AMP and test WAR. In the test jetty
war java classes are *not* packed in the war as in the AMP specification,
but this *must* not have functional impacts on the application

IMPROVEMENTS:
- maven-amp-plugin is *heavily* redundant. must be simplified to package an 
amp and process overlays
- maven-amp-plugin could read maven dependencies and turn them into
module dependencies in module.properties
- maven-sql-plugin to autocreate jetty db
