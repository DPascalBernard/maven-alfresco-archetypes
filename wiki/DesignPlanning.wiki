= Introduction =

This page to discuss practical design/planning/implementation about the next coming archetypes releases.

= 3.2.0 Release Plan =

*Having a deadline* 

we could phase with 3.2 (Labs out in one month, Enterprise in September) release timeframe (alfresco release date + 15dd). Of course we should provide archetypes for Labs and Enterprise version (different functionalities and deadlines)  

*Timebox*

For this release (3.2.0), I'd agree with Mau we should only (I will have a look at restructuring the issues [1] ):
 * (A) Fore-port LDAP,CAS and other 1.x specific functionalities (AMP archetype)
 * (B) Copy maven documentation site, both for the archetypes themselves and for the generated projects
 * (C) Swap trunk/branch-3.0.0-stripped (I'd like to release from trunk)
 * (D) Document (add samples in the archetypes), document, document...
 * (E) Bug fixing and test against 3.2.0 (or trunk)

*Release*
