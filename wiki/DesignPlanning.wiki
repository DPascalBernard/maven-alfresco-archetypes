= Introduction =

This page to discuss practical design/planning/implementation about the next coming archetypes releases.

= 3.2.0 Release Plan =

*Having a deadline* 

We could phase with 3.2 (Labs out 08/2009, Enterprise in 12/2009) release timeframe (alfresco release date + 15dd). Of course we should provide archetypes for Labs and Enterprise version (different functionalities and deadlines). 
This strategy should increase attention and is very marketable with Alfresco.

*Timebox*
For this release (3.2.0):

 * Bug fixing and test against 3.2.0 EE
 * Merge 3.x Maven Calm features
 * align to 3.2.x alfresco-global.properties configuration mechanism
 * Refactor more stuff in maven-alfresco-archetypes superPOM
 * review the [http://code.google.com/p/maven-alfresco-archetypes/issues/list issue list]

*Release*

1.9.x of archetypes is out from trunk featuring Share archetype we should target to have  final 3.2 ready for end of the year
