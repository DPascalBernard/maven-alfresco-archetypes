= Introduction =

This page defines the target use cases for the archetypes/plugins defined in this project. This also defines what is supported/needs to be tested upon new releases of this project.

= Core use cases (functional requirements) =

 # run customized alfresco WAR embedded with Jetty and H2
 # run AMP against a pre-defined Alfresco.WAR embedded with Jetty and H2
 # allow Alfresco WAR and Share WAR to depend on AMPs/JARs, and run WARs with modules embedded in Jetty + H2
 # package AMP and distribute to maven repository
 # package Share JAR modules and distribute to maven repository


== Stretch goals ==

 # run against mysql
 # deploy to running tomcat
 # use jrebel to enable rapid application development
 # by default, share custom WAR should work with Alfresco custom WAR running in jetty (no port conflict, and proper share-config-custom.xml config)
 # provide a way use the SOLR search subsystem (for Alfresco 4.x+)
 # embedded repository scenario (!FirstFoundationClient like). should be possible with the advent of the POMs

= Non functional requirements =

 # being able to reference / switch alfresco version with a maven property
 # support for SCM (svn and git to start with)
 # clean / lean archetypes and fixed dependencies / plugins coming from parent pom
 # support for community / enterprise
 # setup test cases to validate (at least) core user stories
